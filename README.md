Developed an Activity Monitoring Machine Learning Project in Python, utilizing Matplotlib for visualization, which 
implemented a Pattern Recognition Chain (PRC) to classify behavioral activities using the Cognitive Village dataset. 
This involved comprehensive data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation based on 
accuracy and F1-score metrics for robust performance assessment.
